France,86,14,Southwest France,Cahors,Malbec-Merlot,Rigal,"This is a smooth, soft wine that is full of black fruits and ripe tannins. The Merlot rounds out the rougher edges of the Malbec to give a rich juicy wine that will develop quickly. It is all fruit, generous and ready to drink from 2017."
US,86,18,California,California,Chardonnay,The Naked Grape,"This is an easygoing wine that's neither too oaky nor too crisp, with a decent blend of ripe pear and baking spice flavors paired with soft, smooth texture."
US,86,36,California,Sonoma Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Tin Barn,"Blended with small amounts of Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot and Malbec, this is an austere, unfussy red made in modest quantities that has crisp red currant and cranberry flavors interwoven with cedar and dried herb."
France,86,15,Southwest France,Buzet,Merlot-Malbec,Georges Vigouroux,"Closer to Bordeaux than is Cahors, this is Malbec with a cooler visage. It has spice and stalky tannins along with plenty of acidity. The wine is bright with red berry fruits and a crisp lightly mineral aftertaste. Drink from 2018."
France,86,10,Southwest France,Côtes de Gascogne,Ugni Blanc-Colombard,Georges Vigouroux,"This is a blend of 60% Ugni Blanc and 40% Colombard that gives a deliciously light and refreshing wine. Bright and breezy, it is perfumed, herbal and full of direct citrus flavors. Drink now."
US,86,24,California,South Coast,Viognier,Hawk Watch Winery,"Juicy kiwi, lime blossom and sour apple candy aromas show on the nose of this ripe white—the first 2016 submitted from the region. The palate is oily in texture, with honeydew and more lime-kiwi-bubblegum flavors."
US,86,50,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hestan,"Brambly and herbal, this wine shows bright acidity underlying a full-bodied, incoherently ripe palate of tar, toffee and rich cola notes."
Italy,86,45,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,Sangiovese,Il Grappolo,"The nose is a bit shy but eventually reveals underbrush, red berry and a toasted note. The straightforward palate is quite lean, offering raw sour cherry, a green note of powdered sage and a hint of ground pepper alongside raspy tannins that leave an astringent finish."
US,86,48,California,Knights Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon-Cabernet Franc,Ehret,"This Cabernet Sauvignon-dominant blend boasts leather, tobacco leaf and black pepper flavors, giving it muscle and a rustic edge, the tannins and fruit mellowed with age."
US,86,20,California,Paso Robles,Moscato,EOS,"Fans of stickies may find pleasure in this bottling, but it is tremendously sweet and oily. Candied honeydew and kiwi scents meet with sweet juniper and pine on the nose. On the palate, it tastes squarely of golden honey. It's soft, unctuous and thick in consistency."
US,86,17,Washington,Yakima Valley,Pinot Grigio,Martinez & Martinez,"Aromas of ripe (leaning almost overripe) apple, melon and orange peel are followed by medium-sweet fruit flavors. It needs more acid to stand it up."
US,86,12,California,Lodi,Cabernet Franc,Ironstone,"Strong wood smoke and grilled meat aromas lead to equally assertive oak and dried herb flavors, giving this wine extreme personality. It has medium body and rather soft tannins and texture to balance."
US,86,10,California,California,Chardonnay,Leaping Horse,"This medium-bodied wine has more earthy and floral flavors than straightforward fruit, so it's something a bit different. Well-priced and easy to drink, it can please a crowd."
US,86,13,California,California,White Blend,Kitchen Sink,"This wine is dry and substantial, emphasizing earthy, savory flavors over fruity ones. An attractive walnut and almond element carries through from the aroma to the flavors."
US,86,45,California,Napa Valley,Chardonnay,Kuleto Estate,"This is from a hillside estate vineyard and is entirely barrel fermented, its oak subtle and supportive. Medium bodied and not overripe, it offers honeysuckle aromas and lime and lemon rind flavors."
Portugal,86,12,Tejo,,Portuguese Red,Wines & Winemakers,"This state-owned estate of forests and vineyards grows organic grapes. This wine, softly structured and ripe has light black fruits and plenty of acidity. An undercurrent of tannin keeps the wine in order and will allow it to age. Drink from 2018."
Argentina,86,12,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,Rosé,Zorzal,"This copper-tinted rosé of Pinot Noir smells like a rubber gym ball and citrus fruits. A full round bouncy palate brings it around, while dry citrus and stone-fruit flavors show a skins-like quality on a steady finish."
US,86,125,California,Howell Mountain,Cabernet Sauvignon,Charles Krug,"This mountain-grown wine is hugely tannic and oaky, hard to penetrate in its full-bodied ripeness. Smoky oak and currant flavors vie for attention against a backdrop of concentration and power."
US,86,25,New York,Hudson River Region,Riesling,Millbrook,"Savory apples and pears mingle into lemon and bramble in this slightly earthy off-dry Riesling. Sunny tangerine acidity is easy but bright, leading a delicately sweet finish."
South Africa,86,20,Stellenbosch,,Sauvignon Blanc,Waterkloof,"Muted aromas of tart gooseberry and lime peel dance in the bouquet, while pithy flavors of plum skin, currant and citrus rind unfold on the lightweight, slightly astringent palate. Pleasant hints of fresh herbs and saline make a fleeting impression on the close."
Argentina,86,15,Mendoza Province,Valle de Uco,Malbec,Viñalba,"Aromas of prune, raisin and black plum are full and gritty. A chunky full-bodied palate feels grabby, while this tastes of generic blackberry, burnt coffee and dark chocolate. A steady plump, rubbery finish closes the show."
Spain,86,,Levante,Jumilla,Monastrell,Casa de la Ermita,"Aromas of brandied cherry and crème de cassis include a horsey sidenote and some heat. This sweet Monastrell smacks the palate with hard tannins. Flavors of black cherry, cassis and baked plum finish blocky."
France,86,20,Southwest France,Gaillac,Rosé,Château Clément Termes,"This pale pink-grey colored wine is a blend of Duras and Merlot. It is lively and fruity, with a red-currant flavor, delicious crisp acidity and a soft, lively aftertaste. Drink now."
France,86,15,Southwest France,,Gamay,Château Coutinel,This softly fruity wine has the lightest of tannins and plenty of simple red-berry fruits. There is an earthy edge to the young wine as well as plenty of acidity at the end. Drink now.
Portugal,86,7,Alentejano,,Portuguese Red,Adega Cooperativa de Borba,"This broad, fruity wine brings out ripe berry flavors in spades. It has generous fruit, soft tannins and a smooth, open texture. Drink now."
US,91,59,California,Russian River Valley,Pinot Noir,MacPhail,"Let this burly, big-boned beauty open to fully enjoy its robust oak and fistfuls of black cherry, the oak showing in terms of toasty, slightly reductive aromas. A smooth texture keeps the wine flowing along a concentrated highway of power and ripeness."
US,91,49,California,Anderson Valley,Pinot Noir,Foursight,"This small-quantity selection from within the Charles Vineyard was fermented by native yeast, and neither fined nor filtered. It is quite aromatic, full bodied and moderately fruity, and has a nice rounded mouthfeel, generous red-cherry and spice flavors and good structure from acidity and mild tannins. Tart cherry lingers on the finish."
US,91,42,California,Santa Maria Valley,Sparkling Blend,Goat Bubbles,"A deeper salmon color with elegantly lacy bubbles and a slight cloudy appearance, this sparkler by Norm Yost offers dessicated watermelon, dried orange blossoms, yeast, citrus rinds and fresher strawberry notes on the nose. Tart raspberry and yeasty melon show on the palate, which offers a salty component as well as a surprising but nice amount of grip."
US,91,93,California,Napa Valley,Chardonnay,Grgich Hills,"This wine takes time to unravel and reveal itself, rewarding the patient with a wealth of high-toned citrus and elegantly wound, medium-bodied honeyed pear and caramel. Lengthy and complex, it's one to consider aging and allowing to further mellow over time. Drink now through 2021."
US,91,32,California,Anderson Valley,Pinot Noir,Navarro,"This wine is tasty, tangy and nervy, bringing a very refreshing and appetizing mouthfeel, and wonderful fresh acidity. All of that tang shows good fruitiness too, as the red-cherry and cranberry flavors are vivid and concentrated. It's a versatile wine to drink now or buy by the case to save some bottles for more aging."
US,91,20,California,Anderson Valley,Pinot Noir,Navarro,"This medium-bodied wine has a compelling blend of restraint and power. It offers modest, fruity aromas at first, then nice tart fruit flavors that start off lean and soon expand exponentially in the mouth before tapering off elegantly on the finish. With little oak flavor in the way, it gives pure Pinot sophistication."
US,90,100,California,Amador County,Zinfandel,Renwood,"Renwood's tiny two-barrel production of its most expensive Zinfandel has aromas like vanilla and coconut and flavors as rich as milk chocolate and strawberry jam. This full-bodied wine is practically a liquid dessert, though it's not overly sweet. It's full-bodied, smooth and broad in texture."
US,90,50,California,St. Helena,Cabernet Sauvignon,Trinchero,"This is a thick, chocolatey wine with a side of leather and black pepper that appeals on multiple levels. Full-bodied concentration gives way to a smooth, rounded palate robust in blackberry and vanilla."
Spain,90,22,Northern Spain,Rioja,Tempranillo,Pagos del Rey,"Aromas of strawberry, currant and spice are good in a subtle, non-pushy way. Fresh and grabby on the palate, this tastes of red fruits, baking spices and cocoa. Drying tannins along with cassis and chocolate flavors push a healthy finish. Drink through 2020."
Italy,90,45,Sicily & Sardinia,Etna,White Blend,Biondi,"Scents of Spanish broom, pineapple, orchard fruit and a saline note meld together in the glass. The focused palate offers mature apple, peach, botanical herb and mineral alongside firm acidity."
Italy,90,18,Southern Italy,Greco di Tufo,Greco,Cantine di Marzo,"Juicy and delicious, this has aromas of ripe orchard fruit and fragrant Spanish broom. The succulent palate doles out crisp Granny Smith apple, Anjou pear, nectarine and mineral alongside bright acidity."
US,90,45,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Chardonnay,Alexander-Smith,"Fairly light in the glass, this bottling shows chalk, slate and wet-sand minerality on the nose, alongside Asian pear flesh, kiwi and honeydew fruit notes. The texture is quite pithy once sipped, showing grapefruit and apple skins, and then it warms toward yellow pears and a sea salt warmth."
US,90,26,California,Amador County,Barbera,Andis,"Meaty, smoky aromas and good, high-amplitude fruit flavors give a robust personality to this full-bodied, dry and firmly tannic wine. It will make a good pairing with pasta, roasted birds or grilled meat."
US,90,16,California,Sonoma County,Chardonnay,Benziger,"This is a delightfully crisp, elegant and lip-smacking wine, that's subtle and easy to love. Lemon peel, apple skin and pear play together well, never becoming distracting, but instead integrating well with one another and the light hint of oak. Food friendly, it's also a great deal."
US,90,30,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Beaucanon,"While Cabernet Sauvignon dominant, all five red Bordeaux varieties are represented here. Dark in color, a combination of black pepper and black-fruit syrup meets earthy and dry tannins. This structured wine needs time. Cellar through 2020."
US,90,42,California,Adelaida District,Grenache,Brecon Estate,"Quite dark in color, brooding aromas of olallieberry, blackberry, grape soda, plums and concentrated purple flowers appease the nose on this bottling from one of Paso's newly designated appellations. The palate blends licorice, turned earth and eucalyptus with a fresh pomegranate juice flavor."
US,90,38,California,Adelaida District,Zinfandel,Peachy Canyon,"A nose of sour cherry and cranberry meshes with sandalwood and savory herbs on this single-site study by the longtime Paso producer. The palate is overflowing with oregano and other dried garden herbs, laid against a juicy red and purple-fruit frame."
US,90,48,California,California,Rhône-style Red Blend,Three,"Heavy fruit concentration meets thick, velvety tannins in this full-bodied, deeply colored and extremely flavorful wine. It's big enough to pair with big proteins, and concentrated enough to keep improving in the cellar. Best after 2019."
Spain,90,17,Northern Spain,Rioja,Tempranillo,Valdelacierva,"Cherry, plum, vanilla and mild oak aromas feed into a medium-bodied, elegant palate with plum and cherry flavors supported by a touch of toasty oak and vanilla. Notes of café mocha and toast grace a crisp finish that isn't trying too hard."
France,90,18,Languedoc-Roussillon,Coteaux du Languedoc Pic Saint Loup,Rosé,Château de Lancyre,"Attractive fruity tones of red currant, raspberry and strawberry hull dance in the bouquet of this pretty rosé, graced by garrigue accents of lavender and rosemary. Flavors of red berry skin and peach pit unfold on the medium-weight palate, framed by soft tannins and a delicate spice note that lingers on the close."
France,90,15,Bordeaux,Bordeaux Rosé,Rosé,Château Suau,"Lightly structured, this is a balanced, ripe wine. It has profited from the good vintage to offer strawberry, raspberry and citrus flavors that are well balanced and textured. Drink this attractive wine now."
US,90,28,California,Napa Valley,Sauvignon Blanc,Clif Family,"A sublime twist of citrus lies at the heart of this light yet complex white, which is refreshing and layered with a subtle bite of underlying oak. From a dry-farmed vineyard maintained by the same family for 30 years, this whole-cluster pressed wine was given time in a majority of stainless steel and neutral French oak. It shines in moderate acidity and tropical flair."
US,90,25,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Grenache,Santa Cruz Mountain Vineyard,"There is tons of lively action packed into the nose of this wine, from rosebuds and zesty cherry cola to cinnamon spice and rainbow peppercorns. The texture is relatively light on the sip, and yet grippy tannins and a bursting acidity swim across the palate, showing vibrant iron and red-fruit flavors."
US,90,26,Oregon,Applegate Valley,Chardonnay,Schmidt,"Estate grown and aged in Stainless steel, this racy and pungent wine is packed with rich, juicy fruit flavors. Apple, lemon-lime and tangerine are in the mix, showing that Chardonnay does not always need oak flavors to have real power."
US,90,24,California,Edna Valley,Albariño,Stephen Ross,"Clean, sharp and zesty fruit blossom aromas meet with ripe pomelo and green apple scents on the nose of this wine by Steve Dooley. A fresh, tingling acidity shows on the sip, which is a tad sour with stone fruit skins but bountiful in a slate-driven minerality and grippy texture. Cool climate Albariño has much promise in the state."
US,90,55,California,Anderson Valley,Pinot Noir,Goldeneye,"Red-cherry and strawberry aromas meld with rich fruit and warm baking-spice flavors to make this full-bodied wine hard to resist. The style is in the ripe, pastry shop mode, and soft tannins and acidity complete the picture."
US,90,36,California,Napa Valley,Zinfandel,Grgich Hills,"This is an exuberantly fruity, spicy and robust wine, speckled with 2% Petite Sirah. Dark and full of red berry flavor, the palate is dusted in brown sugar and black pepper. Ripe and concentrated, it drinks smooth and elegant despite its serious power."
Spain,90,17,Galicia,Rías Baixas,Albariño,Mar de Viñas,"Aromas of white flowers, stone fruits and lees are typical of well-made Albariño. A juicy, elegant palate with a mix of citrus and stone-fruit flavors is lasting, with a hint of pithy character coming up on the finish."
US,90,40,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Syrah,Kessler-Haak,"Quite vibrant and floral on the nose, this shows deep blackberry and both dried and fresh purple-flower elements as well as a baked berry pastry. The flavors are well integrated on the palate, where cooked blackberries in a vanilla pie crust combine with juicy strawberry, peppercorns and rosemary spice."
US,90,28,California,Ballard Canyon,Malvasia Bianca,Larner,"This most intriguing white grape, which the Larners grow as an ode to their Italian past, shows a sweet nose with a bone dry palate. Sugary citrus scents of orange blossoms and peach syrup give way to a brisk palate full of honeysuckle, night jasmine and a nearly pine needle bitterness that cuts dynamically through it all."
US,89,50,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Bomb,"Reflecting the vintage, this Pinot is light and lithe in style. It shows tart cherry fruit and suggestions of chocolate, with bright acidity and a thin finish."
Greece,89,24,Atalanti Valley,,White Blend,Hatzimichalis,"This wine is a conversation starter, with its nose of mandarin orange, lemon peel and vanilla. On the palate, white flowers, citrus and lush tropical fruits mingle well. Pair with salmon and poultry."
Spain,89,17,Catalonia,Cava,Sparkling Blend,Bohigas,"Dusty, leesy aromas of apple and vanilla are sturdy. This brut Cava is fresh and modestly elegant on the palate, with lime, apple and tarragon flavors. A dry, confident finish offers apple and citrus flavors and a sense of ease."
Greece,89,21,Santorini,,Assyrtiko,Boutari,"Bright aromas of citrus and tropical fruit give this easygoing white an easy appeal. Balanced and fresh, it's an elegant wine that will pair well with grilled fish and salads."
Greece,89,18,Florina,,Malagouzia,Alpha Estate,"Peach, pear and lemon on the nose start this cheerful white from Alpha Estate. On the palate, it offers some complexity of exotic fruit and with a vein of acidity. Soft overall in profile, this wine is easygoing and enjoyable."
Chile,89,20,Marchigue,,Carmenère,Viña Bisquertt,"Lightly herbal, horsey aromas of blueberry, black plum and cardamom are ripe by Carmenère standards. Hailing from a hot vintage, this is a bit flabby in feel, with soft tannins. Chunky plum and blackberry flavors finish with notes of licorice and mint along with a chewy, syrupy feel."
France,89,20,Southwest France,Cahors,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Chateau Quattre,"This well-balanced, fruity wine allows space for some solid dry tannins that also show wood aging. Berry fruits shine through the structure to give a juicy character that is underlined by the fresh acidity at the end."
US,89,24,Oregon,Rogue Valley,Sangiovese,Ledger David,"In this fruit-forward vintage, it's not surprising to find that what shines here are the bright, spicy and tart flavors of strawberries, raspberries and cherries. The Sangiovese was co-fermented with 7% Syrah, and aged in 30% new American oak. As the wine breathes open the flavors of oak and char come up, and the tannins show some extra grip."
Spain,89,44,Northern Spain,Rioja,Tempranillo,CVNE,"Aromas of leather, roast plum and compost are challenging and not immediately inviting. In the mouth, this shows rubbery tannins and juicy acidity. Saucy, herbal plum and currant flavors ride on a beam of acidity toward an earthy, tomatoey finish with a lightly leafy aftertaste."
Chile,89,19,Colchagua Valley,,Red Blend,Estampa,"Staunch berry, cassis and spice aromas are friendly and congruent. This Malbec-led blend is jammy in feel, a bit hollow in the middle, and easy to like as a whole. Blackberry and blueberry flavors finish fleshy, with soft tannins."
US,89,42,California,Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Foxen 7200,"Winemaker Billy Wathen blends 60% Merlot and 40% Cabernet Franc into this blend that's named after the U.S. Geologic Survey's name for Happy Canyon. A nose of dried oregano and thyme has a Bing cherry backdrop, with a palate of green peppers, blackberries and tomato leaf."
US,89,35,Oregon,Oregon,Pinot Noir,Irvine Family Vineyards,"A blend of fruit from three Rogue Valley sites, this is a fine example of the style of Pinot made in Southern Oregon. The estate vineyard sits at 2,100 feet on a steep, east-facing slope, with densely planted vines. It's a big, blocky, full-bodied wine, loaded with flavors of black cherry, black coffee and barrel toast. Tannins are substantial, but the flavors are full and forward. What it lacks in elegance it makes up for in immediate likeability."
Spain,89,44,Northern Spain,Rioja,Tempranillo Blend,Marqués de Cáceres,"Dense, tarry aromas of asphalt and rubbery boysenberry are hefty but also a bit flat. This has a tannic mouthfeel to go with blackberry, prune and raisin flavors. Toast, bitter chocolate and full-bodied weight push the finish on this oaky, ripe Rioja. Drink through 2020."
US,89,16,California,Dunnigan Hills,Syrah,Matchbook,"This medium-bodied wine shows an array of smoky, meaty aromas, along with ripe plum and tart blackberry flavors. Not at all overripe, but made with some restraint, it allows savory flavors like tarragon and anise to peek through. The blend includes 9% Cabernet Sauvignon."
US,89,23,California,Paso Robles,Viognier,Eberle,"The grape's usual peachy aromas show on this wine from regional pioneer Gary Eberle, along with lemon juice, honey and a touch of minerality. There is a nice mineral-driven tension on the palate, with flavors of apple and pear cider. It's a solid, down-the-middle take on the grape—not too ripe, not too thin."
US,89,36,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Silvan Ridge,"Tightly focused, as is often true of single-vineyard bottlings, this matches spicy berry fruit to light barrel flavors of milk chocolate. It's smooth and accessible, but finishes a bit short."
Italy,89,25,Tuscany,Toscana,Red Blend,Tenuta degli Dei,"Crushed plum, espresso, tobacco and cedar aromas unfold in the glass. A blend of 90% Merlot and 10% Alicante, the straightforward palate offers blackberries, red currants, clove and licorice alongside fine-grained tannins."
Italy,89,22,Tuscany,Toscana,Red Blend,Poggio Mandorlo,"Aromas of wild berries, violets and a whiff of spice lead the nose on this blend of Sangiovese and 15% Merlot. The savory, easygoing palate offers mature black cherry, clove and black pepper alongside lithe tannins. Drink through 2016."
Portugal,89,20,Douro,,Touriga Nacional,Quinta das Carvalhas,"Structured and firm, this is a dry wine with the potential of fine fruit in the future. Acidity cuts through the texture promising the freshness of black currants and berries. It's a perfumed wine that can still age. Drink from 2016."
US,89,25,California,Livermore Valley,Chardonnay,Occasio,"This has a light yellow color with a touch of green and a subtle smell of crisp green apples. Flavors that are richer than expected, like poached pears, butter and fig. The texture is rich, the body full and the ripe flavors linger on the finish."
US,89,42,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Pinot Noir,Sanford,"Rhubarb, cola and pencil shavings emerge from the glass on this appellation blend from the longtime Santa Rosa Road winery, today owned by the Terlato family. Deeply earthy aromas of beet juice, root beer and dried berries arise on the palate, showing the region's typical blend of soil minerality and dark fruit."
Chile,89,30,Curicó Valley,,Cabernet Sauvignon-Cabernet Franc,Santa Alba,"Dark, charred, lemony aromas of graphite, licorice and blackberry are horsey and baked. This blend of 85% Cab Sauv and 15% Cab Franc has an intense, blocky, pinching palate and heavy flavors of black fruits, resiny oak, spice and salt. A woody, tannic, raw feel to the finish creates a bumpy landing. Drink through 2021."
Greece,89,17,Nemea,,Agiorgitiko,Boutari,"Aromas of leather, cherry and plum lead this balanced red from Boutari. Ripe cherry, cedar and cinnamon flavors carry the palate, with soft tannins giving a sultry feel."
US,89,49,California,Anderson Valley,Pinot Noir,Foursight,"Made from what Californians call the Pommard clone, this has a light, traditional garnet color. Fresh and lively fruit aromas resemble cranberries and red cherries, followed by tangy fruit and cinnamon flavors of medium intensity, supported by firm acidity and moderate tannins."
France,89,16,Rhône Valley,Côtes du Rhône,Rhône-style Red Blend,Ogier,"This is aged in oak, but the vessels are large casks, or foudres, so the impact isn't that noticeable. The wine is meaty and savory on the nose, but the palate shows more herb-garrigue flavors and superripe cherry fruit. Drink now–2017."
Spain,89,30,Northern Spain,Toro,Tinta de Toro,Pagos del Rey,"Pleasant red-fruit aromas of cherry and raspberry are low in octane for Toro. A fresh but not overly dense palate is lively and vital, with wild berry, plum and brown sugar flavors. A warm, heady, generous finish is fruity and bright. Drink through 2018."
Italy,89,40,Tuscany,Toscana,Sangiovese,Altesino,"Here's a sleek Sangiovese that opens with scents of toasted oak, vanilla, blue flowers and mature plum. The round palate is already accessible, serving up sweet black cherry, black raspberry, licorice and mint framed in assertive but fine-grained tannins."
Italy,89,57,Tuscany,Toscana,Red Blend,Cabreo,"A robust blend of 70% Sangiovese and 30% Cabernet Sauvignon, this offers aromas of baked plum, mocha, menthol and oak-driven spice. The hearty palate initially opens with black fruit, chocolate, licorice and dried herb flavors but the heat of evident alcohol dominates the finish and the close."
US,89,29,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Cameron Hughes,"Juicy and soft in blackberry and black cherry, this wine is nicely resolved in terms of tannin and oak structure,. These provide weight on the back palate, with enough heightened acidity on the finish to stay on balance. Strawberry and dried herb close things out."
Chile,89,61,Maule Valley,,Red Blend,Casa Donoso,"Aromas of latex, tire rubber, spice, cured meat and berry fruits are rugged and require patience to sift through. This Cabernet Sauvignon-led blend is big and grabby, but not precise, with loud, herbal, muscular flavors of stewed plum, licorice and peppercorn."
US,88,25,California,Sonoma Coast,Chardonnay,Rodney Strong,"Focused streaks of high-acidity lemon and a low oak profile combine for a refreshing take on Chardonnay, the other components coming together in swathes of fennel and brine. The wine finishes with a hit of power."
US,88,25,California,Paso Robles,Syrah,San Simeon,"Oak aromas takes center stage with this wine by the Riboli family, with black cherry extract and a nearly Bourbon-barrel character on the nose. The rich, deep red fruit carries to the palate, which gains complexity from licorice and a tiny bit of tar."
US,88,49,California,Sonoma Coast,Pinot Noir,Siduri,"Super earthy, in the classic damp forest-floor way, this also offers hints of menthol, eucalyptus and tomato leaf. The wine begins light bodied, but builds up power and weight as it goes. Layered with black cherry and plum, it's dark and savory."
US,88,20,Washington,Yakima Valley,Picpoul,Syncline,"Stainless-steel fermented and aged, this 100% varietal wine suggests kumquat, talc and wet stone. The flavor concentration is light with taut acidity the focus. It needs food; pair it with shellfish to see it shine."
Argentina,88,26,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Piattelli,"Dark, minty, inky aromas of blackberry are rugged. Same for the palate, which is pinched and rubbery, with grabby tannins. Flavors of toasted, blackened berry fruits are chocolaty and well oaked. Raw heat and minty, coffee flavors rev up the finish on this Malbec-led blend."
US,88,34,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Pondera,"Merlot (57%) takes the lead on this lighter-colored wine that offers raspberries, cherries, herbs and woodspice. The fruit flavors are fresh and elegant, with lightly chalky tannins."
US,88,38,California,Paso Robles,Zinfandel,Tobin James,"This is a lush and powerful wine from a vineyard in the recently designated Paso Highlands district. Aromas suggest gingerbread topped with kirsch-soaked, chocolate-covered cherries. The palate is thick and heavy, with mocha, stewed plums, mashed cherries and black earth, which gain complexity from tannins and pencil lead."
US,88,38,California,Paso Robles,Zinfandel,Tobin James,"Hailing from the recently designated Paso Highlands subappellation, this hearty wine shows earthy aromas of nutmeg, iron, hot rocks, loam and cherry extract. It's lush and ripe with cassis and black cherry fruit, yet shows a more elegant chalkiness on the palate as well, rounded out by cocoa powder."
Spain,88,25,Northern Spain,Valdeorras,Godello,Valdesil,"Apple, nectarine, lees and briny aromas steer this Godello toward a round, full palate. Slightly bitter flavors of melon and peach finish much like the wine starts—briny and leesy. This is also pithy tasting, like the inside of a grapefruit peel."
Spain,87,22,Catalonia,Montsant,Red Blend,Jaspi,"Coffee grinds, raisin and baked aromas suggest overripeness. This is heavy, broad and a bit clumsy on the palate. Berry and prune flavors are solid but not overly fresh, while the finish is full and raisiny as it improves over time."
Argentina,87,15,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,Malbec,Tupun,"Dark-berry aromas are crisp and show a note of minerality as well as barrel char. This is firm, juicy and modest in structure, with flavors of blackberry and cassis touched up by some oak. A non-pushy finish with a hint of mocha is a good close."
France,87,20,Bordeaux,Graves,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Beauregard Lagupeau,Bright fruit is allied to a more mineral structure to give a wine that shows the freshness of the vintage plus a more long-term view. It is cool with red fruits and some firm tannins that act as a background. Drink from 2017.
France,87,25,Bordeaux,Haut-Médoc,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château du Taillan,"Owned by the Cruse family, one of the Bordeaux wine aristocracy, this rich wine is dominated by Merlot, giving it ample weight. The 18 months of wood aging shows in the smoky edge to the wine, although this will soften. Drink from 2017."
France,87,20,Bordeaux,Saint-Estèphe,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château la Haye,"The smoky aroma and toasty wood character smothers the fruit. It is a tough wine at this stage although it does hint at some of the 2012 juicy fruit flavors. Drink this firm, solid wine from 2018."
France,87,20,Bordeaux,Fronsac,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Lalande Mausse,"Intensely tannic, this structured wine has layers of wood aging, along with juicy fruits and bright acidity. There's a strongly smoky element, the wine's fruitiness balanced by a dark, toasty aftertaste. Drink from 2018."
France,87,25,Bordeaux,Haut-Médoc,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Magnol,"This is a smoky, obviously wood-aged wine. The burnt toast character is still dominant, waiting for the attractive black currant fruits to catch up. It will develop into a bright, fruity wine, so wait until 2017."
US,87,10,California,California,Chardonnay,Grand Pacific,"A creamy, buttery texture wraps around a core of bright lemon and apple flavors. This is balanced slightly toward sweetness as the luxurious viscosity carries the vivid flavors into the finish."
US,87,18,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Malbec,Hamilton,"This saignée-style wine is pale salmon in color, showing some bricking. It drinks dry with rounded suggestions of cherry and watermelon providing easy-drinking enjoyment."
US,87,18,New York,Finger Lakes,Chardonnay,Heron Hill,"Zesty and mineral, this unoaked, citrusy Chardonnay would make a particularly refreshing apéritif. Flavors of Asian pear and quince are crisp and cutting on the palate. Enjoy now for it's vivacious style."
US,87,14,New York,Finger Lakes,Riesling,Heron Hill,"Smoke and violet perfume are seductive on this elegant off-dry Riesling. Fresh green apple and pear flavors are tart but concentrated, wrapping up tightly with a squeaky-clean, lemon-lime finish."
US,87,14,New York,Finger Lakes,Riesling,Fox Run,"Intense notes of crushed stone and slate permeate this stately off-dry Riesling. Pert lemon and tangerine flavors are zippy and fresh, but the wine is more a showcase for its brisk, stony style."
US,87,40,New York,Finger Lakes,Cabernet Franc,Glenora,"Figs and spice perfume this tawny Cabernet Franc ice wine. It's a bit rustic in style, evoking layers of fallen leaves and potpourri melding with dusty raisins and figs. But it's elegantly crisp and the exotic, uniquely spicy character is seductive."
France,87,18,Bordeaux,Médoc,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Roc Taillade,"This ripe, now soft wine has gentle red fruits and soft acidity. It's ready to drink with its rich texture and smooth structure. The end is rounded, only just hinting at tannins."
France,87,20,Bordeaux,Haut-Médoc,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Sénéjac,"Owned by the same family as Château Talbot in Saint-Julien, this vintage of Sénéjac is now mature, showing signs of leather and a firm structure rather than fruit. It's unlikely to develop further, so drink now."
US,87,10,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Gewürztraminer,Chateau Ste. Michelle,"This is an aromatic wine with notes of rose water, pear and white flowers. It drinks medium sweet with abundant spice flavors throughout. Pair with spicy Thai dishes."
US,87,11,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Merlot,Castle Rock,"The aromas of this wine suggest plum, herb and pencil eraser. It's full flavored with dark blue fruit and chalky, dry tannins. An affordable and approachable wine best enjoyed now."
US,87,36,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon,Dussek Family Cellars,"Though just four years old, this wine seems advanced with notes of dried cherry, vanilla, dried tobacco and blackberry. The dried cranberry and cherry flavors are rich and tart, backed by quite astringent tannins."
US,87,20,New York,Finger Lakes,Cabernet Franc,Serenity,"Tawny in color and wafting of potpourri and fallen leaves, this raspberry-inflected wine is already starting to show its maturity. Briskly concentrated and light on its feet, it makes an elegant sip to enjoy now before it loses its delicate, perfumed charms."
US,87,32,Washington,Wahluke Slope,Grenache,Sol Stone,"The aromas on this wine are quite light, conveying wood, herbs and red fruit. This contrasts with the sweet, rich fruit flavors with a gentle grip of tannins."
Spain,87,18,Catalonia,Cava,Sparkling Blend,Sumarroca,"A mix of smoke and toast blends with fresh, crisp citrus aromas on the nose. That's followed by a foamy, reactive palate with flavors of pink grapefruit, orange, pepper and caramel. This remains foamy on the finish, which is peppery and slightly bitter in flavor."
Portugal,93,55,Douro,,Portuguese Red,Poças,"A big, ripe and spicy wine, this is packed with woody notes as well as powerful fruit. It has solid tannins and dark flavors of bitter chocolate and black cherries. It's rich and concentrated, with good aging potential. Drink from 2018."
Italy,93,49,Piedmont,Barbaresco,Nebbiolo,Rizzi,"Blue flower, ripe berry, baking spice and mint aromas lead the nose on this full-bodied, elegant wine. The palate delivers juicy black cherry, crushed raspberry, cinnamon, licorice and mineral alongside firm, ripe tannins. It's young but already displays a great combination of structure and finesse."
US,93,50,California,Rockpile,Zinfandel,Robert Biale,"There is earthy darkness and a hint of the forest in this Zin, grown at high elevation in the rocky soils of the Rockpile appellation, these vines planted in 2001. The wine is magnificently structured with complex, ripe blackberry and cherry compote coming to the fore slowly and seductively."
Italy,93,58,Piedmont,Barbaresco,Nebbiolo,Sottimano,"Crushed raspberry, blue flower, tilled soil and graphite aromas lead the nose on this firmly structured wine. It's still very young and needs to open up fully, but the palate already displays breeding and class. It offers ripe black cherry, ground black pepper, licorice and grilled sage alongside tightly wound but fine tannins. Drink 2018–2026."
France,93,39,Alsace,Alsace,Riesling,Domaine Jean-Luc Mader,"The chalk soil of the Rosacker vineyard has produced a rich, intensely fruity wine that is shot through with steely minerality and a wonderful perfumed character. It's so crisp and fresh while also being densely textured and complex. The wine has a long future, drink from 2017."
France,93,65,Alsace,Alsace,Riesling,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"Beautifully balanced, this conveys both rich fruit and a tense, intense minerality. Combining the two strands impeccably, it brings out tangy apple and pink grapefruit flavors and a steely, tight acidity. It's a structured wine that needs to age. Drink from 2018."
Morocco,93,35,Guerrouane,,Syrah-Grenache,Bernard Magrez,"Tones of black cherry, toffee, tobacco, tar and violet show boldly on the nose and palate of this Moroccan red. Powerful tannins provide a suitable backdrop for fruit and spice flavors alongside an ever-present sense of brightness that lasts into the finish."
Italy,93,80,Piedmont,Barolo,Nebbiolo,Borgogno,"Intense aromas of dried rose, leather, truffle and crushed berry lead the nose. The ripe, forward palate offers crushed black cherry, wild raspberry, cinnamon white pepper and sage alongside chewy tannins. Drink 2015–2022."
France,93,42,Alsace,Alsace,Riesling,Domaine François Schmitt,"Paradis is a parcel within the Pfingstberg Grand Cru, giving particularly fine and rich Riesling. This ripe and full-bodied wine manages to preserve all the elegance and style of the grape while having full tropical fruits, juicy acidity and a warm, rounded aftertaste. It will certainly age, so drink from 2017."
France,93,61,Alsace,Alsace,Riesling,Gustave Lorentz,"This late release, aging for five years, has produced a majestic wine. Its breadth of flavor, with ripe fruits as well as intense structure, are gently transitioning from the first flush of youth to a more mature character. Intensely textured, tight, ready to spring, it shows the beauty of maturing Riesling. Drink now, although it will age many more years."
US,93,58,Washington,Red Mountain,G-S-M,Force Majeure,"Produced for Force Majeure by Syncline's James Mantone, this riveting wine is a blend of 47% Mourvèdre, 42% Syrah and 11% Grenache. Lush and redolent with wild berry and wet rock aromatics, it carries a thread of sweet grain along with bright, detailed berry fruit and balancing acidity. Delicious already, it can be enjoyed now through 2020."
US,93,38,California,Paso Robles,Mourvèdre,Anglim,"More people would crave Mourvèdre if it were done in this style, with light rather than heavy leather scents alongside purple fruits. Once sipped, it hits the tastebuds with blueberry soda, tobacco, licorice, black pepper and wild game, all restrained and juicy rather than brooding and thick."
France,93,48,Alsace,Alsace,Riesling,Domaine Ostertag,"Rounded, rich and full in the mouth, this offers swathes of flowery, aromatic fruit that is still young, still in its primary stage. With just a hint of steely texture, the wine does have structure and aging potential. For now, it is generous and delicious."
US,93,50,California,Napa Valley,Zinfandel,Robert Biale,"The winery's proprietary block of Zin grapes (planted in 1999) from the coveted Stagecoach Vineyards contributes to an intense wine. Juicy and oaky, it's dense in cherry and plum, a note of lavender and sage complementing the whole. A thick liqueur sense characterizes the texture, but the palate stays alive through the site's rocky minerality. This one'll age."
Italy,93,58,Piedmont,Barbaresco,Nebbiolo,Sottimano,"Ripe and delicious, this starts off with aromas of fresh violet, rose, perfumed berry, exotic spice and tilled earth. It's still young but the palate already delivers a great depth of flavors including juicy black cherry, crushed raspberry, clove and black pepper alongside chewy tannins. Drink 2016 to 2021."
France,93,120,Bordeaux,Sauternes,Bordeaux-style White Blend,Château Raymond-Lafon,"From one of the many recent exceptional years in Sauternes, this ripe, unctuous wine has balanced the rich honeyed fruit and the drier edge of botrytis. It's full in the mouth, with Seville orange and a light touch of ginger. Drink from 2019."
US,93,50,California,Fort Ross-Seaview,Syrah,Red Car,"A case study in cool-climate, estate-grown Syrah, the white pepper on the nose and palate is playful and exuberant, the acidity buoyant and lingering. The fruit takes on hushed tones of wild berry and bramble, with a soft texture inviting one in for more."
US,93,80,Washington,Red Mountain,Cabernet Sauvignon,Force Majeure,"Chris Gorman is the winemaker for this pure, old vine Cabernet Sauvignon. Despite the high alcohol and the use of 100% new French oak, most of the old vine nuances are still there—a wild mix of heather and herb with berry and grain scents that weave together in the mouth. Brambly and tart, with strawberry and cherry fruit, it's a compelling wine that keeps you on your toes."
US,93,40,California,Santa Barbara County,Syrah,Mulvane Wine Co.,"Addictive aromas of hot blackberry pie laced with cinnamon, allspice, cola nut and a stewed cherry sauce reveal the promise of this popular Los Alamos Valley vineyard. Dark plum fruit, but with the acidity of the plum skin, meets with candied flavors of blackberry syrup and the freshness of soda water. A hedonistic Syrah."
Portugal,93,41,Douro,,Portuguese Red,Caves Aliança,"Almost ready to drink, this wood-aged wine is packed with herbs, dark berry fruits and the first signs of secondary spice and leather flavors. The tannins are still powerful and need to soften further, so drink this complex, concentrated wine from 2016."
US,93,48,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Cabernet Sauvignon,Double Canyon,"Somewhat light in color, this is an aromatically appealing wine that shows a complex assortment of coffee, vanilla, pencil lead, cherry, blueberry and high-toned herbal notes. It's exquisitely polished in its styling, with plush tannins and a long, lingering finish. A pretty expression of the variety that shows a great degree of elegance and deftness, it drinks well out of the gate but continues to improve with additional time to breathe."
US,93,200,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Diamond Creek,"From a seven-acre section of the vineyard, this offers plenty of saddle leather and cedar amidst spicy cardamom layers, a soft, juicy core and tingling acidity. The structure and weight suggest the ability to cellar comfortably through 2020."
US,93,39,Washington,Red Mountain,Petit Verdot,Côtes de Ciel,"Pure Petit Verdot from Red Mountain's quintessential Bordeaux varietal vineyard—does it get any better? Big, deep and tannic, with lovely purity, this features ultraripe fig and plum fruit with a pleasing salinity. The finish is persistent and shows a streak of iron. Note the alcohol is pushing 16% however it is beautifully integrated."
US,93,62,Washington,Red Mountain,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sparkman,"Principally Klipsun vineyard fruit, this is a mass of black cherry and cassis, wreathed in smoke from aging in 80% new French barrels. Great balance and length carry it through into drying tannins. A perfect steakhouse Cabernet."
Italy,93,43,Piedmont,Barbaresco,Nebbiolo,Punset,"Structured and energetic, this has a balsamic nose that offers aromas of menthol, mint, fennel, ripe berry, leather and a whiff of violet. The palate delivers crushed red cherry, black raspberry, baking spices and licorice alongside assertive tannins and fresh acidity. Drink 2017–2025."
France,92,35,Alsace,Alsace,Riesling,Domaine Ehrhart,"This ripe, full wine has both great minerality and rich white fruits that are aromatic as well as very fresh. The fruits are laced with citrus to give a complex wine that deserves aging. Drink from 2017."
France,92,48,Alsace,Alsace,Riesling,Domaine Zinck,"Floral aromas lead into a rich, not quite dry wine that is beautifully ripe and perfumed. It is rounded and opulent while preserving the steely, mineral texture. Still young, it demands aging. Drink from 2017."
France,92,55,Alsace,Alsace,Riesling,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht,"As its name implies, this wine comes from chalk soil, giving both a strongly mineral character and ripe tropical fruit flavors. It's rich, full in the mouth, dry but with such a ripe character there seems to be some sweetness. It's impressively full and ready to drink now."
Portugal,92,40,Alentejano,,Portuguese Red,Dona Maria-Júlio Bastos,"Produced from old vines, this is an impressive wine, rich and dense. It brings together dark tannins and opulent black fruits that cushion the firm structure. A lively acidity and a silky character show that the wine is ready to drink."
Italy,92,69,Piedmont,Barbaresco,Nebbiolo,Fontanafredda,"This opens with a pretty fragrance of violet, exotic spice and perfumed berry. The juicy palate doles out ripe black cherry, crushed raspberry, freshly ground pepper, mocha and anisette. It's nicely balanced with fresh acidity and firm but polished tannins."
France,88,16,Bordeaux,Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Chantemerle,"Smoky and toasty, this is a structured wine. It has layers of black currant fruits, fresh acidity as well as firm tannins that overlay the juicy fruitiness. It needs to age. Drink from 2016."
France,88,16,Bordeaux,Bordeaux Blanc,Bordeaux-style White Blend,Château Chaubinet,"While the wine is rich, it's also very crisp and fruity. Tight acidity and a chalky, steely texture are balanced by ripe apples and pink grapefruit. It's a wine for drinking this year, bright and fruity."
France,88,,Bordeaux,Pessac-Léognan,Bordeaux-style White Blend,Château Ferran,"A tight and herbaceous wine that is crisp, mineral and fresh. It shows a great potential for fruitiness, with natural juicy acidity as well as a bright, aromatic aftertaste. Drink from 2016."
France,88,15,Bordeaux,Côtes de Bourg,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Fongalan,"Round and velvet smooth, it has blackberry fruits that are full in the mouth, giving freshness while also making the wine rich and generous. The tannins are already well-integrated into this soft wine. Drink from 2015."
France,88,13,Bordeaux,Bordeaux Blanc,Bordeaux-style White Blend,Château Mezain,"Crisp and deliciously fruity, this is lively and bright. Acidity points up the lime and grapefruit flavors, leaving a fresh, juicy aftertaste. Drink now for maximum pleasure."
US,88,28,California,Carneros,Chardonnay,Clos du Val,"Full-bodied and resplendent in ripe apple and brioche, this well-crafted wine is layered and smooth. It would pair well with grilled salmon or herb-roasted chicken."
US,88,36,Oregon,McMinnville,Pinot Noir,Coeur de Terre,"Toasty scents and flavors of the barrels (40% new) cloak tart raspberry fruit. It's clean and efficient, though for the moment at least, the barrel flavors outrun the rather light fruit. That can change over time, so give this one until 2015 or so in bottle."
Romania,88,9,Colinele Dobrogei,,Rosé,Cramele Halewood,"This playful pink has fun aromas of cinnamon, red berry and bubble gum that lead to flavors of sour cherry and red plum on the palate. The finish is big, fruity and generous."
US,88,24,California,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Daniel Gehrs,"Bright orange juice, dill herbs and a slight whiff of vanilla bean lead the aromas on this un-oaked Chard. On the palate, flavors of apple cider come with a wash of fresh lime juice on the back end."
US,88,30,California,Russian River Valley,Rhône-style White Blend,Davis Family,"This white combines 48% Roussanne with 35% Marsanne and 17% Viognier to creamy, tropical effect, its balance between ripe melon and pear fruitiness and spiced acidity well woven. From one of the few sources of some of these grapes in the Russian River Valley, this Rhône-inspired wine is ready to pair with lobster or a roast turkey dinner."
US,88,25,California,Sonoma County,Merlot,Decoy,"Taking time to come around aromatically, it opens up with plum and bright red cherry fruit that follow on the palate, a touch of savory tobacco suggested around the tannins. On the finish expect a balance of spice and sweet as black pepper and caramel compete for affection."
Italy,88,34,Piedmont,Barolo,Nebbiolo,Reversanti,"Made for early drinking, this bright wine delivers red berry fruit lightly accented with sage and baking spices. It's not an ager so enjoy now through 2020."
US,88,60,Oregon,Chehalem Mountains,Pinot Noir,Roco,"Sourced from the estate vineyard—the same vineyard that fuels the Private Stash reserve—this shows a dusty, somewhat charred character, presumably from the barrel aging. Along with the slightly burnt toast character comes plenty of black cherry fruit, and acids that leave a slightly chalky impression in the finish."
US,88,54,California,Carneros,Pinot Noir,Saintsbury,"The other realm of the coin from Brown Ranch, Toyon is leaner and lighter, its color even subdued, a study in wild strawberry and layered floral highlights, oak and cardamom spice. It bristles with acidity, pleasant to sip on its own or with bacon-wrapped figs."
US,88,15,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Muscat,Silvan Ridge,"This is a frizzante style of Muscat, the pressure slight enough to allow for a screwcap seal. Off-dry, spicy and aromatic, it's a great sipping wine, with concentrated flavors of sweet orange-pekoe tea."
Italy,88,56,Piedmont,Barolo,Nebbiolo,Silvano Bolmida,"This opens with aromas of black plum, oak, espresso, black pepper, balsamic notes and a whiff of barnyard. The bracing palate delivers crushed dark cherry alongside oak sensations of espresso, toast and vanilla. Aggressive wood tannins cut this short and give an astringent finish."
US,88,20,California,Napa Valley,Sauvignon Blanc,St. Supéry,"The winery's signature widely distributed white is heady in flowery jasmine, with vibrant acidity and a sense of sweetness on the palate thanks to fresh fruit flavors of grapefruit, peach and nectarine. An ideal wine for summer or whenever one needs to recall a summer's day."
US,88,61,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Pinot Noir,Testarossa,"Smells of rust, iron, tomato and untracked peppercorns rise to the nose. On the palate, the wine is quite light and racy, with a little boysenberry and more sanguine flavors. Hold onto this one until 2016 for maximum enjoyment, as more flavors will emerge."
Italy,88,46,Piedmont,Barolo,Nebbiolo,Trediberri,"Black plum, chocolate-covered cherry and mocha sensations come together alongside forceful tannins. It's rather ripe and forward for the vintage. Drink 2018–2025."
Spain,88,30,Northern Spain,Cigales,Tempranillo,Val de Los Frailes,"This is brilliantly purple in color, with jumpy, untamed black-fruit aromas. In the mouth, it is tannic and clawing, with a cheek-drilling mouthfeel. Syrupy blackberry flavors offer baking spice and clove accents, while the finish is showing unabsorbed oak and monster tannins."
Spain,88,17,Central Spain,La Mancha,Tempranillo Blend,Yuntero,"Dusty black cherry and dark plum aromas are ripe and friendly. This is a plump, modern-style red with a clean mouthfeel and weight. Berry fruits, spice and oak flavors blend well, while the finish is, in general, full, smooth and adequately fresh. Tempranillo with 10% Petit Verdot."
France,88,,Loire Valley,Crémant de Loire,Chenin Blanc-Chardonnay,Musset-Roullier,"This fresh and fruity sparkling wine is crisp with apple skin and apricot flavors. Ripe and full in the mouth , it has a lightly creamy mousse. The blend of Chenin Blanc and Chardonnay gives delicious fruitiness and tight final acidity."
US,88,40,California,Paso Robles,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot,Oso Libre,"Chalky earth, black pepper and clove comprise the nose on this wine, which gets a boost from 10% Merlot. The flavors are spicy and complex, with cedar, tea and a tiny bit of varietally distinct green pepper."
US,88,39,California,Paso Robles,Red Blend,Oso Libre,"Oso Libre ventures into the nonvintage category with this blend of 10 wines from the past five years, delivering a nose with blackberry and a pinch of pepper. The meaty wine really gets your attention once sipped, with boysenberry, cracked peppercorn, some iron and a lingering licorice flavors."
Italy,88,49,Piedmont,Barolo,Nebbiolo,Palladino,"Made from vineyards throughout the village of Serralunga d'Alba, this straightforward wine is still closed. It reveals black cherry, espresso, prune and subtle oak alongside a note of tire rubber. It's still extremely young, with aggressive tannins that dry out the finish."
France,88,23,Loire Valley,Sancerre,Sauvignon Blanc,Pierre Prieur et Fils,"A lemon-scented, crisp wine, it's also full of ripe yellow fruits. It's a warm in style, rich with both fruit and an open texture. Almonds and acidity give a refreshing aftertaste."
US,88,16,California,Monterey County,Pinot Grigio,Bargetto,"This is a great sunny day wine, starting with aromas of honeydew melon, ripe nectarine and lemongrass. There is a slightly peachy, bubblegum character once sipped, with lemon-lime soda in the midpalate and a flinty, gunmetal finish."
US,88,32,California,Paso Robles,Mourvèdre,Adelaida,"A brighter, more mineral- and acid-driven take on the often rustic Rhône grape, this kicks off with fresh smells of raspberry and rock. The palate brings tart cherry, followed by just-ripe black berry and really ripe raspberry on the midpalate, and a tartness on the finish."
US,88,18,California,Santa Barbara County,Chardonnay,Alma Rosa,"There's a lot happening on nose of this wine from Sta. Rita Hills pioneer Richard Sanford's recently rejuvenated Alma Rosa label. Aromas suggest light butterscotch, baked pear, fresh pluot and jasmine. Once sipped, the flavors don't live up to the aromatic promise, but apple, pear and a sharper tangerine rind round out the flavors."
Argentina,88,15,Mendoza Province,Agrelo,Cabernet Sauvignon,Lamadrid,"Immediately this smells raisiny, but with time secondary scents of cinnamon and Middle Eastern spices come into play. The body is soft and extracted, with modest acidity. Flavors of baked black fruits, fig paste, chocolate and herbs follow the nose, as does a chocolaty, rich  finish. Drink through 2016."
France,92,92,Burgundy,Beaune,Pinot Noir,Domaine de Bellene,"Packed with tannin, it is not showing much sign of fruit yet. It is dark, brooding and very firm in texture, with just with a hint of juicy black cherry flavors. Wait until 2017 before drinking."
France,92,94,Burgundy,Chassagne-Montrachet,Chardonnay,Domaine Vincent Girardin,"A very fruity wine, it shows rich wood flavors as well as equally rich fruit. It is complex, very mineral in character, tight and nervy. The citrus fruit is matched by the apricot flavor, putting down layers of acidity. Don't drink before 2017."
US,92,58,California,Coombsville,Chardonnay,Failla,"The southern Napa Coombsville area is near San Pablo Bay, making it a cool area. In this vintage, it shows the acidity and mineraity of its terroir, but also the ripeness Chardonnay can achieve in a good vineyard, with orange and apricot flavors enhanced with oak. Drink now."
US,92,50,California,Amador County,Rhône-style Red Blend,Gallica,"From the estimable Shake Ridge Ranch, winemaker Rosemary Cakebread has fashioned a lovely blend from 53% Grenache, 31% Syrah, 14% Mourvèdre and 2% Viognier. Opening with leathery tannins, the rich and savory concoction imparts juicy dark plum, tobacco and especially coffee."
US,92,48,California,Russian River Valley,Sparkling Blend,J Vineyards & Winery,"The vintage was a great one not only for J's dry table wines but for its sparklers. This brut, a classic Chardonnay and Pinot blend, with a drop of Pinot Meunier, is dry, with complex lemon, orange, yeast, vanilla, cream and toast flavors. The bubbles are ultra-fine, raising the appeal."
US,92,32,California,Sonoma Coast,Pinot Noir,Les Voleurs,"This is such a good Pinot, and so reflective of the Sonoma Coast, that its price makes it a steal. With low alcohol and brisk acidity, it's translucent in color, with a gleaming ruby hue. The mouthfeel is silky and delicate, yet the raspberry, cola and buttered cinnamon toast flavors are intense. Drink now–2020."
Italy,92,27,Northeastern Italy,Alto Adige,Pinot Bianco,Nals Margreid,"This wine has more structure and depth than most Pinot Biancos from Alto Adige, thanks to vineyard location and 20% aging in large casks. It delivers sensations of apples and exotic fruit along with a flinty note. The creamy texture is brightened by lively acidity."
Portugal,92,35,Vinho Verde,,Alvarinho,Provam,"Pure Alvarinho from the Monção region, it's rich, creamy and textured. Lined with great acidity, it also has intense apple, bitter orange and a strongly herbal element. While it's ready to drink, this complex wine will benefit by waiting until 2015."
Portugal,92,95,Douro,,Portuguese White,Quinta Nova de Nossa Senhora do Carmo,"This wood-aged wine comes from a small parcel of old vines in the Quinta Nova vineyard. With its ripe, smooth and creamy texture, it has a full, almost Burgundian feel. Ripe peach combines with vanilla to make a wine that has concentration and richness, cut with final acidity."
US,92,43,California,Santa Maria Valley,Pinot Noir,Ryan Cochrane,"A great follow-up to the winery's 2011, made this time from an esteemed vineyard in one of the coldest parts of the valley. The vintage was difficult, but the wine is rich in raspberry, cranberry and persimmon flavors, brightened by crisp acidity and finishing totally dry. There's no reason not to drink it now."
Italy,92,33,Veneto,Soave Classico,Garganega,Suavia,"Here's a delicious Soave with depth and character. Floral aromas of Spanish Broom and chamomile take center stage, accented by a smidge of exotic fruit and graphite. The juicy palate offers honeydew melon, white peach, ripe pear, citrus and mineral purity balanced by fresh acidity."
Italy,92,60,Northeastern Italy,Alto Adige,Sauvignon,Cantina Terlano,"Classic varietal aromas include stone fruit, crushed tomato vine, freshly cut grass and green melon. The palate offers a depth of flavors that include creamy white peach and ripe cantaloupe that are brightened by firm acidity. It closes on a flinty mineral note."
France,92,,Southwest France,Cahors,Malbec,Château du Cèdre,"The estate wine from Château du Cèdre is anything but simple. A powerful series of tannins and dense black fruits offer both a dark texture and great fruitiness. Acidity comes through strongly and, with the tannins, promises aging. Drink from 2017."
France,92,30,Bordeaux,Graves,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Haut Selve,"The minty aromas indicate new wood aging as well as a ripe, polished texture. They make for a wine that has presence and structure as well as rich fruitiness, blackberry flavors and a dry, solid core. It's a sophisticated wine that can age. Drink from 2017."
US,92,100,California,Mount Veeder,Cabernet Sauvignon,Communication Block,"Made from 100% Cabernet, this wine shows the intensity of fruit that Mount Veeder is capable of expressing. It also has excellent acidity. But the tannins are astringently strong, giving a numbing sting to the palate. This certainly needs time. Give it until 2022 and beyond."
US,92,35,California,Monterey County,Syrah,Baker & Brain,"Right out of the bottle, this 100% Syrah delights for its overall balance and deep, rich array of cherries and blueberries. If you pay attention, you'll find more complex layers of sautéed wild mushrooms, grilled prosciutto and toast. Dry and tannic, and would be ideal with roasted lamb."
France,91,60,Burgundy,Santenay,Chardonnay,Domaine de Bellene,"There is a great balance here between the creamy fruit and the wood flavors. Apricots, ripe apples and melon are spiced with the right amount of toastiness. The wine has a rich, warm feel. It is still young, so wait until 2015 to drink."
France,91,16,Southwest France,Côtes du Tarn,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Domaine D'en Ségur,"Hugely tannic at this stage, this dense and complex wine has great structure partnered with dark black fruit and licorice. There is forward bitterness, suggesting this wine needs aging. Drink from 2017."
France,91,40,Burgundy,Pouilly-Fuissé,Chardonnay,Domaine Sangouard-Guyot,"This is a ripe and smoothly textured wine. It is already finely balanced, rich with toast, apricot fruits and a tight, mineral character. It is enjoyable now but will age well until 2022."
US,91,60,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Elk Cove,"Sourced from a 15-acre vineyard on Parrett Mountain, this displays single vineyard specificity. Entry is surprisingly soft, and (perhaps influenced by the name) there seems to be a pleasing clay-like quality to the mouthfeel. Clean blueberry fruit leads into a tasty, balanced finish."
France,91,100,Burgundy,Clos de Vougeot,Pinot Noir,Evening Land,"Still firm and closed, this is a structured wine, solidly tannic with just hints of fruit. It has a dry feel to it, firm, the acidity and red fruits coming through the leathery, dark texture. The wine needs aging, so drink from 2017."
Portugal,91,18,Alentejano,,Touriga Nacional,Herdade de São Miguel,"Violets, truffles and ripe black fruits are present in this structured wine. It has almost too much richness, but there is plenty to admire. Solid tannins, a dark, heavy texture and complex acidity all show aging potential. Drink from 2018."
US,91,16,Oregon,Oregon,Pinot Gris,Iris Vineyards,"Sourced from the Chalice (estate) vineyard, this aromatic and seductive wine presents a compelling mix of tree fruits, racy acidity, and a rich, textural, open mouthfeel. The flavors of pears, orange peel and snappy spices linger deliciously through a long finish."
US,91,42,California,Paso Robles,Syrah,Jack Creek,"This is a gigantic Syrah, a tsunami of blackberry jam and milk chocolate, with headier notes of cassis liqueur and toasty buttered oak. That sounds sweet, but the wine is thoroughly dry. The tannins are thick, but finely ground and negotiable now. It might last in the bottle for many years, but there's no point in aging it. Enjoy now with elaborate roasts and stews."
France,91,,Southwest France,Jurançon Sec,Gros and Petit Manseng,Lionel Osmin & Cie,"A ripe, wood-aged wine, it's richly smoky and fruity at the same time. The blend brings out honey, ripe apricots and peach. Acidity cuts through at the end to give a final, delicious lift. Drink now, but best wait until 2015."
US,91,20,California,Napa Valley,Pinot Noir,Brick & Mortar,"The hue is an elegant peach just starting to blush with pink. The wine is entirely dry, with low alcohol framing intricate flavors of peaches, limes and vanilla, brightened by crisp acidity."
Italy,91,25,Northeastern Italy,Alto Adige,Sauvignon,Colterenzio,"A savory Sauvignon with intensity and balance, it has aromas of cantaloupe and crushed tomato vine. The vibrant palate offers juicy green melon, pineapple and citrus together with a mineral note. Fresh acidity leaves a clean, crisp finish."
Italy,91,23,Northeastern Italy,Alto Adige,Pinot Grigio,Colterenzio,"This savory Pinot Grigio has a little weight on it thanks to grape selection and 20% aging in large barrels. It delivers classic Granny Smith apple, Bartlett pear, nutmeg and flint in a creamy texture brightened by fresh acidity."
US,91,38,California,Carneros,Pinot Noir,Cuvaison,"With a light, silky mouthfeel and mouthwatering acidity, this Pinot satisfies for its rich array of raspberries, cherries, spices, cola and smoky oak. It defines the Carneros style: tart, a little earthy and ageworthy. Drink now–2019."
